so yeah, i got really greedy and converted my blog to a shared tier, but it doesn&#8217;t support AlwaysOn. Well, lets fix that.

Just créate a webjob with the following script (you have to name it something.ps1)

```
$url = 'url goes here'
while ($url) {

    $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
    [void]$wc.DownloadString($url)
    Write-Output "Info:Success"
    Start-Sleep 550

}
```
